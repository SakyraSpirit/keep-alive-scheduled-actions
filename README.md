# Keep alive your GitHub scheduled actions ðŸ“… ðŸ•— âœ…

Maybe GitHub showed you a warning (as you can see on the warning below) on one of your scheduled GitHub actions.

![This scheduled workflow is disabled because there hasn't been activity in this repository for at least 60 days.](./github-actions-warning.png)

If so, let's consider implementing a Keep-Alive strategy.

Take a look at the [keepalive.yml][1] action. This scheduled action runs at 00:42 UTC on the 1st of every month.

A [.keepalive][2] file is added with the current date-time (human-readable) at the repository root and commits it.

Feel free to [report][3] any issues, and make pull requests to improve this
GitHub action.
